Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck.
Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness, and sheer stupidity all
occur to test the limits of your soul.
Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved,
straight, flat road to nowhere.
It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless.
