## Stack-and-Queues
Problems from Stacks and Queues 


1. Check balancing of symbols (like ‘{‘, ‘(‘, ‘[‘ ) and their order using stack.

2. Evaluate postfix expression using stack. Example: postfix fix expression is 6 5 2 3 + 8 * + 3 + *

Hint: When number is seen, it is pushed onto the stack; when an operator is seen, the operator is applied to the two numbers that are popped from the stack, and the result is pushed onto the stack.

3. Design a queue to which stores process details like process id, arrival time, execution time and priority. Determine the turn-around time and waiting time for each jobs for following scheduling algorithms.

a. First Come First Serve

b. Shortest Job First

4. Design a stack using a single queue as an instance variable, and only constant additional local memory within the method bodies.

5. Suppose you have a stack S containing n elements and a queue Q that is initially empty. Write function that use Q to scan S to see if it contains a certain element x, with the additional constraint that your algorithm must return the elements back to S in their original order. You may use S, Q and a constant number of other variables.

6. Design a queue using two stacks as instance variables, such that all queue operations execute in amortized O(1) time.
